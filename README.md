## *What is this Password Vault?*
Password vault is an application coded in C++, which helps users to store certain passwords, codes, or anything personal into a more secured area.

## *How does this work?*
The app has a simple encrypting/decrypting system which hides the passcodes into a file. The file will be saved in the same directory where the executable file is.

## *How can I add passwords?*
There is a button written *'Add Item'*, when you press this a window will pop up. There you will have two fields:
+ Name
   - Short info regarding what this passcode is about.
+ Passcode
   - The actual passcode.
   
## *How can I remove passwords?*
Simple, select the passcode you wish to discard, right click it
